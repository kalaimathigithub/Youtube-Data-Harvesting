# Features

- Harvest data from YouTube channels using the YouTube Data API.
- Store the data in MongoDB for easy access and retrieval.
- Migrate data from MongoDB to a SQL database for more extensive data analysis and querying.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

  Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python
